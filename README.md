## Alternative-communication-with-single-muscle-EMG
ALS, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a disease causes the death of neurons which control voluntary muscle. In the situation, about 30% of people will lose their ability to communicate normally, requiring the use of technology to compensate. The goal of this project is to develop an alternative communication system based on single-muscle EMG signal input. The system should be cheap, and should allow patients affected by severe forms of ALS to communicate, even when they can only control a single muscle in their body.
